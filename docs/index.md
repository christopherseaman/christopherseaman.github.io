## *Hands-on Data Science Builder*

# About me

With over two decades of experience, I'm a seasoned data scientist who excels at **transforming raw data into actionable insights**. What truly distinguishes me is my unwavering commitment to cultivating a culture rooted in the ideals of DevOps: *Locality and Simplicity*, *Flow and Joy*, and the *Improvement of Daily Work*. I thrive tackling complex problems and propelling business success through technology. As a leader, I'm recognized for my ability to motivate teams to create impactful solutions that seamlessly bridge the gap between data-driven insights and tangible outcomes.

Driven by the ideals of DevOps, I have fostered thriving team cultures by cultivating an environment where **collaboration** and **shared ownership** flourish. A prime example of this approach was an early bundling test for Jira: a test that initially quadrupled signups but led to a dip in conversions. Instead of viewing this as a setback, the team and stakeholders embraced transparent communication to question assumptions and devise new tests. After several iterations, this approach yielded a resounding success, forming the foundation of the bundling strategy still in use today.

# Core strengths

- **Data system architecture**: Proficient in designing and implementing scalable data systems in AWS and GCP, including the Atlassian Marketing & Growth stack, ensuring data reliability, performance, and security. The system served as a model when product analytics were built later.
- **ML & experimentation expertise**: A hands-on leader, establishing a *culture of measurability* by building experimentation platforms, processes, and teams while collaborating closely with champions across the organization. Achievements: $100m+ incremental ARR, substantial active user wins, and always setting clear success criteria for new features.
- **Culture & team development**: Mentored data science teams and directly contributed to projects, fostering ideals of innovation and continuous learning. This approach enabled the development of innovative features while simultaneously increasing release cadence
